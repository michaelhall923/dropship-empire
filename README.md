# dropship-empire
This is a Laravel site I am currently working on. It is meant to help drop shippers find products to sell by aggregating hot products from different sites such as AliExpress and displaying useful information such as potential profit margin.

- There are some screenshots in the "screenshots" folder.
- View files are in /resources/views
- Model/Controller files are in /app
